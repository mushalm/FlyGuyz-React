                        This litepaper (the “Litepaper”) has been created in
                        order to serve as a guide for the existing and future
                        members (the “Members”) of Fly Guyz Decentralized
                        Autonomous Organization (the “DAO”).
                      </p>

                        The DAO is designed to sustainably develop a diversified
                        portfolio of crypto-assets and accrue value for its
                        Members. At the time of the DAO's inception it was felt
                        that it resembles a mere club or society (such as a
                        collectors club or the like) whereby Members choose to
                        come together virtually to engage in a common set of
                        interests. The sole fact that substantial funds or
                        NFT-assets amongst others could be involved does not
                        diminish nor diverge from the hobbyist nature of the
                        DAO. Many of the Members share a common passion for the
                        nascent space of blockchain games and digital art, while
                        others also share a deep desire to explore new forms of
                        decentralized governance.
                      </p>
                      <p className="fs-15 text-light fw-normal mb-3">
                        At the time of drawing-up this Whitepaper, it is clear
                        that a significant lack of legal framework exists to
                        assist with the formation and governance of DAOs in
                        general. As such, it should be understood by all who
                        freely choose to engage with the DAO that Fly Guyz is
                        not an incorporated entity and has no legal personality,
                        nor standing in any jurisdiction or domicile. Moreover,
                        any natural or legal persons or entities that purport to
                        represent the DAO in any capacity have no legal ability
                        to do so and cannot be held liable in any way or form
                        for the actions of the DAO and its Members. This is of
                        course not stated as an exoneration of any individual or
                        group who choose to engage in or commit any criminal
                        activity (such as fraud, theft, etc.).
                      </p>
                      <p className="fs-15 text-light fw-normal mb-3">
                        As the space in which the DAO will be active is a new
                        and experimental one it should go without saying that
                        all Members should understand that it is speculative in
                        nature and thus carries inherent risks. In addition,
                        there are numerous bad actors in this space who are
                        intentionally trying to scam others out of their funds.
                        Though none of this diminishes the passion and
                        enthusiasm of the DAO and the Member ought to remain
                        cautious and vigilant at all times. Nothing stated
                        herein shall be construed as financial or investment
                        advice and all who choose to participate in and engage
                        with the DAO are to speak to their relevant (financial,
                        tax, etc.) advisors. For the record, the DAO is in no
                        way being formed to assist anyone with any form of tax
                        evasion or avoidance. It is expected that everyone
                        participating in and engaging with the DAO will
                        endeavor, to the best of their abilities, to be in
                        compliance with their relevant tax codes and the rules
                        set out by the relevant tax authorities. For the record,
                        the DAO does not provide investment advice with respect
                        to the funds held by the DAO.

                        It is the DAO's intention, to the best of its abilities,
                        to keep abreast of the current legal codes and take
                        guidance from the best practices that are being
                        developed in this new and experimental space.

                        As we believe that $FLYY is so heavily empowered by our
                        community, we want to decentralize leadership into
                        different committees and task groups that can focus on
                        social media presence, charitable efforts, blockchain
                        development, crypto education and more.

                        In order to be as fair as possible, DAO voting power
                        will be given to two types of holders that have a
                        minimum stake in the $FLYY ecosystem.

                        Holding at least 10000 $FLYY and/or 1+ FLYGUYZ NFT will
                        empower someone with a vote in the DAO. This minimum
                        stake guarantees a seat at the table, but each person
                        only has one vote in any matter. This effectively stops
                        whales from being able to buy the vote, and
                        decentralizes ownership to a fair point.

                        The purpose of the DAO will be to govern the protocol,
                        manage treasury funds and decentralize leadership by
                        placing $FLYY directly into those that are the most
                        invested.

                        distribution to community governance, $FLYY aims to be
